Release 0.6.2 (Feb. 7, 2017)
============================

Highlights
----------

-  Support for triggering multiple dependent feeds

-  Added a flag to allow operations manager to query and display NiFi
   bulletins on feed failure to help show any logs NiFi generated during
   that execution back in operations manager

-  Fixed NiFi provenance reporting to support manual emptying of flow
   files which will now fail the job in ops manager

-  The Audit Log table in Kylo will now track feed updates
